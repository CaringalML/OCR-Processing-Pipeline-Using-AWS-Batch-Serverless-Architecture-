## Budget and Cost Management

- Uses the same Claude API budget as other OCR processing
- Invoice processing may use more tokens due to structured extraction
- Budget alerts configured for 90% threshold
- Cost tracking per invoice available in processing results

## Monitoring and Alerts

### CloudWatch Alarms
- **Invoice DLQ Messages**: Alerts when processing fails
- **High Message Count**: Alerts for systemic issues
- **Processing Duration**: Monitors for timeout issues

### Logs
- Invoice uploader logs: `/aws/lambda/{project}-{env}-invoice-uploader`
- Invoice processor logs: `/aws/lambda/{project}-{env}-invoice-processor`

## Usage Examples

### JavaScript/Node.js

```javascript
const invoiceData = {
  file: fileBase64,
  fileName: "invoice.pdf",
  contentType: "application/pdf",
  vendorName: "Tech Solutions Inc",
  invoiceNumber: "TS-2025-001",
  totalAmount: "2500.00",
  currency: "USD",
  invoiceType: "standard"
};

const response = await fetch('/batch/short-batch/invoices/upload', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify(invoiceData)
});

const result = await response.json();
console.log('Invoice uploaded:', result.fileId);
```

### Python

```python
import requests
import base64

with open('invoice.pdf', 'rb') as file:
    file_base64 = base64.b64encode(file.read()).decode('utf-8')

payload = {
    "file": file_base64,
    "fileName": "invoice.pdf",
    "contentType": "application/pdf",
    "vendorName": "Tech Solutions Inc",
    "invoiceNumber": "TS-2025-001",
    "totalAmount": "2500.00",
    "currency": "USD"
}

response = requests.post(
    'https://api.yourhost.com/batch/short-batch/invoices/upload',
    json=payload
)

result = response.json()
print(f"Invoice uploaded: {result['fileId']}")
```

## Benefits Over Standard OCR

1. **Specialized Processing**: Invoice-specific prompts and field recognition
2. **Structured Output**: Organized JSON data instead of raw text
3. **Enhanced Accuracy**: Optimized for financial document formats
4. **Business Integration**: Ready-to-use structured data for accounting systems
5. **Field Validation**: Built-in validation for invoice-specific fields
6. **Cost Efficiency**: Targeted processing reduces unnecessary refinement
