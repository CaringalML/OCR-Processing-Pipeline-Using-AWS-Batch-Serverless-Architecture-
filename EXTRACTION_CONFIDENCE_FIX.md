# Extraction Confidence Fix - COMPLETED ✅

## Problem
The `extractionConfidence` field was showing "unknown" instead of the actual confidence level from Claude AI, and it was positioned inconsistently in the response structure.

## Root Cause
The invoice processor was looking for `extraction_confidence` at the root level of the structured data instead of in the nested `document_metadata.extraction_confidence` field where Claude AI actually returns it.

## Solution

### 1. **Fixed Data Extraction in Invoice Processor**
Updated the extraction path to correctly get the confidence level:

**Before**:
```python
'extraction_confidence': invoice_data.get('extraction_confidence', 'unknown')
```

**After**:
```python
'extraction_confidence': invoice_data.get('document_metadata', {}).get('extraction_confidence', 'unknown')
```

### 2. **Fixed Database Update**
Updated the DynamoDB update expression to use the correct nested path:

**Before**:
```python
':confidence': ocr_result.get('extraction_confidence', 'unknown')
```

**After**:
```python
':confidence': ocr_result.get('structured_data', {}).get('document_metadata', {}).get('extraction_confidence', 'unknown')
```

### 3. **Repositioned Field in Response**
Moved `extractionConfidence` right after `processingDuration` in both individual and list views for better organization:

**Response Structure**:
```json
{
  "fileId": "abc123",
  "fileName": "invoice.pdf",
  "processingDuration": "2.45 seconds",
  "extractionConfidence": 92,  // ✅ Now shows percentage (0-100) and positioned correctly
  "vendorName": "ABC Corp",
  // ... other fields
}
```

### 4. **Removed Redundant Field**
Eliminated duplicate `extractionConfidence` that was being added later in the response processing.

## Expected Values
Claude AI now returns confidence as a percentage (0-100):
- `90-100` - All key fields clearly visible and extracted with high certainty
- `80-89` - Most fields extracted successfully, minor uncertainty on some values
- `70-79` - Good extraction but some fields unclear or missing
- `60-69` - Moderate extraction quality, several fields uncertain or missing
- `50-59` - Fair extraction, document readable but many fields problematic
- `30-49` - Poor extraction, document quality issues affecting readability
- `0-29` - Very poor extraction, document barely readable or heavily corrupted

## Files Modified
- `lambda_functions/invoice_processor/invoice_processor.py` - Fixed extraction logic
- `lambda_functions/invoice_reader/invoice_reader.py` - Repositioned field and removed duplicates

## Testing
After deployment, `extractionConfidence` should show numerical confidence percentages (0-100) instead of "unknown", and be positioned right after `processingDuration` in the API response.

## Updated Claude AI Prompt
Added detailed confidence scoring guidelines to help Claude provide accurate percentage assessments:
- Clear percentage ranges with specific criteria
- Guidance on how to assess document quality and field extraction success
- Standardized scoring methodology for consistent results
