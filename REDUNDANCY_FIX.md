# Redundant Processing Cost Details - FIXED ✅

## Problem
The invoice reader API was returning duplicate `processingCostDetails` blocks:
1. At the root level of the response
2. Inside `invoiceData.processingCostDetails`

## Root Cause
The `format_invoice_data()` function was already including cost details in the formatted invoice data, but the main response handler was also adding the same information at the root level.

## Solution
Removed the redundant `processingCostDetails` block from the root level response in the invoice reader, keeping only the one inside the formatted invoice data structure.

## Before (Redundant):
```json
{
  "invoiceData": {
    "processingCostDetails": {
      "totalCost": 0.025914,
      "inputTokens": 3118,
      ...
    }
  },
  "processingCostDetails": {  // ❌ REDUNDANT
    "totalCost": 0.025914,
    "inputTokens": 3118,
    ...
  }
}
```

## After (Clean):
```json
{
  "invoiceData": {
    "processingCostDetails": {  // ✅ SINGLE SOURCE
      "totalCost": 0.025914,
      "inputTokens": 3118,
      "outputTokens": 1104,
      "totalTokens": 4222,
      "inputCost": 0.009354,
      "outputCost": 0.016560000000000002,
      "costPer1kInputTokens": 0.003,
      "costPer1kOutputTokens": 0.015,
      "ocrLlmProvider": "Claude API",
      "currency": "USD"
    }
  }
}
```

## Files Modified
- `lambda_functions/invoice_reader/invoice_reader.py`: Removed redundant cost details block

## Impact
- Cleaner API responses
- Reduced response size
- Single source of truth for cost information
- Better data structure consistency

The cost details are now properly located within the `invoiceData.processingCostDetails` section where they logically belong.
